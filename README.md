# LoginForm
Login Form Using HTML, CSS, and Node.js! 🌟

 👋 I'm excited to share my latest accomplishment - I've successfully created a login form using HTML, CSS, and Node.js, and I did it without using any third-party libraries like Express! 🎉👨‍💻

🔗 Here's a quick overview of the project:

📝 *HTML & CSS:*
I designed a clean and user-friendly login interface using HTML and CSS. The form is styled using CSS for a sleek and professional look.

html
<!-- HTML -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!-- meta tags and title -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- login form -->
</body>
</html>


css
/* CSS (style.css) */
/* Styles for the login form */


💡 *Node.js Server:*
I used Node.js to create a simple server that serves the HTML and CSS files to the client. The server listens on port 3000.

javascript
const http = require('http');
const fs = require('fs');

// ... (server code)


🔍 *Routing:*
I implemented basic routing to serve the HTML and CSS files appropriately based on the URL path.

javascript
// ... (routing code)
